During this time, a suspected drug transaction took place in plain view of the front door camera. An individual on a pushbike approached, exchanged money for a small packet containing a white substance with the resident, who then returned inside. Previous observations and reports indicate ongoing drug-related activity at Flat 14, including suspicious visitors, disturbances, and direct witnessing of similar transactions.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Reported To:<\/strong><br \/>\nWDH (now vico homes) | The Police | Logged on this CMS<\/p>\n<p><strong>Details:<br \/>\n<\/strong>On<strong> May 13th<\/strong>, <strong>2025<\/strong>, at approximately <strong>05:01, <\/strong>the resident of Flat Number 14 was observed exiting his flat, immediately walking and loitering in front of Flat Number 15.<br \/>\nThis is in violation of his conditional order yet is quickly becoming a more frequent daily occurrence.<br \/>\nThe resident was seen pacing for approximately three minutes outside Flat 15.<br \/>\nDuring this time, a suspected drug transaction was captured on the front door camera.<br \/>\nAn individual wearing either a balaclava or a black cap and hoodie arrived on a pushbike.<br \/>\nThe resident of Flat 14 retrieved a small packet containing a white substance from his pocket and held it while the individual on the bicycle produced money.<br \/>\nThe two then exchanged items: the resident handed over the packet and accepted the cash before returning inside.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Additional Context:<br \/>\n<\/strong>* There have been ongoing concerns regarding suspected drug activity at Flat 14 for years now.<br \/>\n* The resident has been overheard, through the bathroom ceiling, speaking on the phone about selling cocaine and storing proceeds in a digital account called &#8220;nest&#8221;.<br \/>\n* Individuals with suspicious behavior have previously approached us, inquiring about the resident of number 14 and expressing a need to &#8220;get some stuff.&#8221;<br \/>\n* There have been multiple incidents of disturbances, including a anorexic woman in distress shouting and banging at Flat 14\u2019s door, reportedly due to an inability to purchase substances.<br \/>\n* Both us and other neighbors have witnessed suspected drug transactions at Flat 14\u2019s door on several occasions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Video:<\/strong><br \/>\nThe first three minutes of the resident\u2019s pacing have been condensed in the attached video for brevity.<br \/>\nThe footage then slows to normal speed to clearly show the arrival of the individual on the pushbike and the subsequent exchange.<br \/>\nThis incident is consistent with an ongoing pattern of suspected drug-related activity and repeated breaches of the resident\u2019s conditional order.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong> <video controls=\"controls\" width=\"600\" height=\"340\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"display: inline-block;

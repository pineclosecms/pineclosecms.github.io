He briefly moved out of camera range for approximately 30 seconds before returning to his flat.<br />
11:32 AM: Our living room camera captured him outside our property, holding his phone in a manner suggesting he was recording or attempting to view the interior of our bedroom and living room windows.<br />
11:33 AM: he was observed at our front door (One minute later).<br />
His actions, including moving his phone up and down while looking around, indicated he was more than likley recording our entryway.<br />
He then returned to his flat.<br />
6:30 PM: he was observed standing at our front door, staring, then moving towards the bin area before returning. His behavior suggested he was checking for witnesses.<br />
7:05 PM: he left his residence, heading towards the park up the hill.<br />

10:24 PM: he then passed by again, moving towards the front of the property.<br />
10:25 PM: he approached our front door and stood staring for several seconds. He attempted to discard his cigarette in our outdoor pet water bowl, initially missing. He then bent down, retrieved the cigarette end, and deliberately placed it in the water.<br />
He retreated backwards, maintaining his gaze on the door, seemingly waiting for a reaction. After pausing at a distance, he moved towards our bins before returning to his flat.<br />
All incidents from 6:30 PM onwards have been reported to the police via their online chat system, as advised due to high call volumes. The report has been forwarded to PC O&#8217;Neil.<br />

<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>On September 14, 2024, at approximately 07:15 the resident of 14 Pine Close exhibited disruptive behavior yet again, including prolonged periods of walking around and shouting, presumably on the phone, at 4 AM. The situation escalated when the individual spat on our door, disposed of a half smoked cig in our pet water bowl turning it yellow, and removed our chairs, leaving them down the road. This incident has been reported to the police via 101, PC Daniel O&#8217;Neil via email, and Sam Palmer, our council representative, through One Call, who has been updated on the ongoing issues.</p>
<p>At approximately 7:15 AM, the neighbor emerged from his residence, smoking a cigarette while pacing in front of our door area. After two minutes of this behavior, he positioned himself near our outdoor chairs, which we use as a bird table due to a previous incident where he attempted to break in by smashing them against our door. He partially finished his cigarette and discarded it into the pet water bowl turning it yellow before returning to his flat.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, the individual reappeared, briefly surveying the area before retreating to retrieve his dog. He then stood on the grass with the dog while continuing to look around, only to return the dog to his flat after a short period. Two minutes later, he reemerged, fixating on our door and chairs, he spat at our front door again, and walked past. He was then observed moving slowly across the area, seemingly checking for witnesses. He approached our chairs, stared at them, looked around once more, and proceeded to take them, walking towards the road. Finally, he hurriedly returned to his flat, walking past a man from over the road with his dog, Sid, in the process. (seen in at end of the longer uncut video).</p>

<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
Logged on this CMS | WDH  | The Police via 101</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>On August 16, 2024 at approximately 09:58AM, security camera footage captured the following incident involving the tenant of flat 14: The individual was observed walking his dog in the vicinity of our residence, frequently glancing towards our entrance. After briefly returning to his unit, the tenant reappeared, and his shadow was visible on the ground. At this point, the footage shows him retrieving a metallic object and propelling it at our door, causing distress to our cats (which woke us up). Subsequently, the tenant returned his dog to his flat. Approximately 20 seconds later, he approached our front door directly, appearing to speak to himself. Upon reaching our doorstep, he directed his attention to a water receptacle we maintain for the benefit of neighborhood pets. The tenant then deliberately damaged this container, fracturing it into two pieces, before retreating to his own residence.</p>
<div>
<p>The previous night audible disturbances emanated from upstairs. The tenant was overheard engaging in a loud, prolonged telephone conversation. Based on the content of this call, it appeared that the individual was attempting to procure illicit substances, an activity that has been observed to occur on a daily basis.

					<description><![CDATA[Summery: On the 15th of June, 2024, the individual residing in flat number 14 was observed via our security footage&#46;&#46;&#46;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>On the 15th of June, 2024, the individual residing in flat number 14 was observed via our security footage making an offensive gesture with his middle finger directed at the camera while passing by our window. Additionally, towards the conclusion of the video clip, he is seen making a similar gesture towards the bedroom window, where a non-functional camera is installed.</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
Logged on this CMS for Joe at WDH to see</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Annoying</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>At approximately 4:48 PM, the resident of number 14 proceeded to take his dog outside for its 20 second a day walk to the adjacent grassy area. Subsequent to re-entering his flat with the dog, he then navigated towards the side of the flat&#8217;s. Upon passing by the window, he abruptly turned back and gestured inappropriately towards the surveillance cameras. Attached is a video recording captured by our living room security camera. It should be noted that another camera, located in our bedroom, was also subjected to the offensive gesture; although currently non-operational, its presence is discernible in the latter part of the attached video.</p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> basic Microsoft webcam in living room window<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>On June 8, 2024, disturbances began around 1:30 AM with noises akin to hammering. The individual from flat number 14 was suspected of searching for surveillance cameras, as evidenced by his behavior with his dog and previous incidents involving his associates. Despite considering contacting WDH’s out-of-hours service, the intermittent cessation of noise led us to refrain. Later, the tenant exhibited suspicious behavior outside, including feigned phone conversations and observable flashes from his phone camera, suggesting covert recording activities. At 3:20 AM, he approached the door, likely recording, and at 3:42 AM, he struck an exterior light fixture. These actions are consistent with past observations of drug-related transactions and usage, specifically cocaine, as well as withdrawal symptoms during periods without narcotics.<br />
<strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
WDH and the police</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Caused stress that negatively affects Lucy&#8217;s heart condition&#8217;s<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Stressed, Annoying, logged as &#8220;endangerment&#8221;,</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>On the 8th of June, 2024, at approximately 1:30 AM, we were disturbed by loud noises resembling hammering, which interrupted our sleep and prompted us to consider contacting the out-of-hours service provided by WDH. However, the noise ceased intermittently, leading us to believe it would stop like normal, rendering a service call potentially unnecessary. Subsequently, just before 2:00 AM, we observed the individual from flat number 14 descending the stairs with considerable force, ostensibly to walk his dog. We have reasons to suspect that his true intention was to search for surveillance equipment, a behavior we have witnessed on multiple occasions. This suspicion is supported by the fact that he was observed pacing back and forth and interrupting the dog’s natural behavior, as captured in the accompanying video at the 44-second mark.</p>
<p>Our <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><em><a style="color: #00ccff; text-decoration: underline;" href="/12may2024/">previous incident report</a></em></span></span> includes footage of an associate of the tenant from flat number 14 attempting to open our door while the tenant himself stood by his own door, presumably to ascertain the presence of a camera monitoring that area.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, at 2:31 AM, the tenant returned outdoors without his dog and loitered for several minutes. This activity is highlighted in the video with a motion-tracing arrow. During this time, he appeared to engage in a phone conversation, but the intermittent flashes from his phone camera, particularly when he moved through shadowed areas, suggest otherwise. These flashes are evident in the video at 1:30 and again at 2:24.</p>
<p>At 3:20 into the video, the tenant approaches the door, continuing the pretense of a phone conversation, likely with the intent of recording video footage. We believe this was done to scrutinize the area for cameras with greater detail at a later time. Shortly thereafter, he is seen striking the exterior light fixture, an act clearly visible in the video at 3:42.</p>
<p>This incident appears to be another instance of erratic behavior, which we have observed to correlate with periods when the tenant lacks narcotics. Such behavior includes restlessness and involuntary movements, symptomatic of withdrawal from potent drugs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">While we cannot definitively identify the substance involved, there is a strong likelihood that it is cocaine, based on repeated observations of the tenant engaging in transactions involving white powders at his doorstep. This has been corroborated by several neighbors and is further evidenced by frequent visits to vehicles and motorcycles, as well as audible indications of drug use, including chopping sounds, snorting, and exclamations, occurring sporadically throughout the day and night.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Summery: on the 12th May 2024, at 9:51PM, an individual known to associate with the resident of unit number 14&#46;&#46;&#46;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>on the 12th May 2024, at 9:51PM, an individual known to associate with the resident of unit number 14 was observed attempting to gain unauthorized access to our residence. This person repeatedly returned to our property, engaging in suspicious behavior that suggested an intent to vandalize or forcibly enter. Accompanying this individual was another person, whom we have strong reasons to believe is the tenant of number 14. This belief is substantiated by prior observations of their association, auditory evidence of movement on the staircase correlating with their presence, and their recurrent proximity to the front area of number 14.<br />
The situation necessitated my intervention to vocally confront the individual in question to prevent further escalation, considering the severe health risk posed to an individual with pre-existing heart conditions, and the potential for property damage.</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
We told the police by phone whilst inquire about a callback that was due over two months ago. However, it seems improbable that the report was logged, as we have yet to receive any follow-up communication from them.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Very stressful and not good for Lucy&#8217;s heart conditions and now she can&#8217;t sleep until the sun comes up every night from stress of everything.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Very stressed, not good for Lucy&#8217;s heart condition, Associated with the tenant of number 14.</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>At precisely 9:51 PM, an individual previously observed in communication with the occupant of flat number 14 was witnessed manipulating the door handle of our flat. Initially, the individual approached the door directly and appeared to attempt entry using the side of their hand, presumably to avoid leaving fingerprints. Upon realizing the door was secured, the individual departed, initially veering right, then returning left in the direction of residence number 14.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, it became evident that the individual was not alone, as another person appeared alongside them in the video footage. It is our assertion that the primary subject is the tenant of number 14, who has both the motive and the history to justify suspicion of tampering with our property. This individual’s known involvement in drug-related activities lends credence to the likelihood of a quid pro quo arrangement, wherein the accomplice was compensated with narcotics for meddling with our door.</p>
<p>In light of the distressing situation, particularly due to the potential health risks posed to Lucy, an individual with pre-existing heart conditions, I felt compelled to address the individual at the door. My intent was to inquire about their actions and to insist on their departure to alleviate the stress on the aforementioned individual. The responses received were slurred and punctuated with giggles, indicative of intoxication, presumably resulting from substances obtained from the tenant of number 14.</p>
<p>Following this confrontation, we heard sounds consistent with someone ascending the staircase. Although the noise was quieter than usual, the timing aligned with the observed activities.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Conversation:</strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Me shouting to the guy outside before Lucy had a stress heart attack (Video + Audio below)</span><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> The F**k you doing?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy Outside:</strong> inaudible</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me <em>(to Lucy)</em></strong> what did he say?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Lucy <em>(to me)</em></strong> I Don&#8217;t know, i can&#8217;t tell..</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> what are you doing out there</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy Outside:</strong> I&#8217;m Waiting</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> For what?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy Outside:</strong>*Inaudible mumbling*</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> Waiting for what</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy outside:</strong> More inaudible mumbling</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> What?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy Outside:</strong> I&#8217;m waiting for my mate</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> Well why are you waiting outside our door?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy Outside:</strong> *Inaudible mumbling&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> We&#8217;ve seen you try the handle</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy outside:</strong> I Didn&#8217;t try the door handle, what you talking about?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> We just saw you try the F****ng door handle</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy Outside:</strong> I didn&#8217;t try the door handle, I&#8217;m waiting for my mate</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Me:</strong> Well, stop pissing about outside the house and go wait somewhere else</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Guy outside:</strong> Alright (<em>walks towards number 14, then goes upstairs</em>)</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>On the 26th of April, 2024, our sleep was disrupted by significant noise. Upon consulting our security camera, we observed the resident of unit number 14 engaging in the forceful dismantlement of our bird feeder affixed to the wall. A review of the recorded footage revealed that at 1:50 AM, this individual directed an offensive gesture towards our room camera. At 2:32 AM, he was documented returning to the front of the property, where he loitered and exhibited restless behavior.<br />
At 5:30 AM, the individual emerged with his dog, seemingly conducting a visual inspection of the surroundings. After escorting the dog back inside, he returned alone and proceeded to vandalize our bird feeder. Subsequently, at 5:50 AM, he was captured by the living room window repeating the offensive gesture and uttering a phrase that could be interpreted as a derogatory remark, before retreating to his residence.</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
WDH and the police</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Caused a lot of stress that negatively affects Lucy&#8217;s heart condition&#8217;s<strong>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Stressed, Annoying, logged as &#8220;criminal damage&#8221;,</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>At approximately 5:30 AM, we were abruptly awakened by a series of loud bangs and heavy footsteps. Upon awakening, we observed through our door camera’s live feed that the individual residing at flat number 14 was forcibly removing our bird feeder from the exterior wall. It appeared that the feeder was detached, possibly by severing the steel core cable ties securing it. Subsequently, the individual was seen off-camera compressing the feeder and discarding it into our brown waste container.</p>
<p>In response to this disturbance, we reviewed the recorded footage from the entire night and early morning. The recordings revealed that at 1:50 AM, the same individual was present at our living room window, making an obscene gesture directed towards it. Later, at 2:32 AM, the individual was again captured by the camera returning to the front of our residence and began to walk back and forth near our front door.</p>
<p>The initial commotion that roused us at approximately 5:20 AM included more banging and stomping, audible even through silicone earplugs. The footage shows the individual exiting his residence with a dog, surveying the area as though to ensure no one was present. He then returned the dog indoors and re-emerged alone, continuing to pace near our front door while frequently glancing towards it, as if anticipating someone’s appearance. This behavior persisted for roughly ten minutes, during which he expectorated on the door and proceeded to rearrange our outdoor chairs before ultimately damaging and removing the bird feeder, as previously described.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the bird feeder had been installed for approximately one year, serving as a replacement for a prior feeder that had been similarly vandalized.</p>
<p>At 5:50 AM, the individual was once again observed making an obscene gesture towards the camera and appeared to verbalize an insult, which could be interpreted as “f**k off you stupid bastards,” before retreating to his flat.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Summery: On the 1st of April, 2024, an abrupt and considerable disturbance in the form of a loud noise abruptly&#46;&#46;&#46;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>On the 1st of April, 2024, an abrupt and considerable disturbance in the form of a loud noise abruptly interrupted our sleep. This was immediately followed by the sound of someone hastening up the staircase. A review of our CCTV system footage indicated that the individual residing in flat number 14 had passed by our door. Within a brief interval of approximately one minute, the loud noise was once again detected, after which the same individual was observed returning at a quickened pace and ascending the stairs.<br />
Upon the morning of the next day, the cause of the disturbance became apparent: a damaged drainpipe was discovered in a state of disarray upon the ground, evidently the source of the noise from the previous night.</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
WDH | Police</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Annoying he keeps trashing things and WDH haven&#8217;t just evicted him by now. (and later employed him a few months later despite all this!)<br />
Logged with council (<del><span style="font-size: 11pt;">who are going to repair it</span></del> who have now repaired it ) Also logged with police.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Stressed, Had to get WDH to Repair,</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>We were abruptly awakened by a substantial noise, which was discernible even through the use of silicone earplugs. This was swiftly succeeded by the sound of an individual ascending the staircase. Upon reviewing our door’s CCTV footage, it was observed that the resident of flat number 14 had traversed past our foor. Approximately one minute subsequent to their passage, the aforementioned noise was audible, followed by the individual’s hastened return and subsequent ascent of the stairs.</p>
<p>An inspection of the windows yielded no discernible cause for the disturbance, prompting our return to repose. However, the following morning, en route to our shopping endeavors, we encountered the source of the previous night’s disruption: a drainpipe, now in a state of disrepair, lay upon the ground with its fixtures severely damaged and scattered.</p>
<p>We have documented the condition of the drainpipe through photographs and have appended these to our incident report. Additionally, we have provided a recording from our door’s CCTV system, which captures the individual’s movements both prior to and following the incident.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>On the 9th of March 2024, we experienced an intrusion of privacy when we were disturbed by the sound of our letterbox being manipulated. Surveillance footage revealed the individual residing at number 14 engaging in suspicious activity involving our letterbox. This individual was documented using a mobile device to peer inside our letterbox on two separate occasions: initially at 4:14 AM, and subsequently at 6:10 AM. During the latter instance, the device’s flash was activated, and the camera application was visibly in use, suggesting the capture of photographic or video content. This evidence was promptly compiled and submitted to the police for investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
WDH and the police</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Made us worried he will try doing something again, possible checking what camera we have and where they are as he seemed to be recording and/or taking pictures with his phone, and he&#8217;ll be aware that the cameras can be viewed behind the front door from the time he previously put a brick through it.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Tired, Very Stressed, Lucy has stress chest pain, and can&#8217;t sleep</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>In the early morning hours, we were awakened by a disturbance which was subsequently identified as the sound of our letterbox being tampered with. Upon reviewing the footage from our security cameras, it was evident that the individual responsible was the occupant of the flat at number 14. This person was observed utilizing a mobile device to peer into our letterbox.</p>
<p>The presumed intent behind this action is to ascertain the locations of our security cameras. This deduction is based on the fact that immediately behind the entrance door, there is a laptop display that provides a live feed of two such cameras. The individual’s awareness of this setup is likely due to a previous incident where they hurled a brick through our window, which afforded them a view of the interior.</p>
<p>The initial occurrence of this behavior was recorded at precisely 4:14 AM, during which the individual was seen loitering and subsequently inspecting the letterbox with their phone, presumably capturing images or video. A subsequent incident was observed at 6:10 AM, which we witnessed in real-time, having been unable to return to sleep in anticipation of further disturbances.</p>
<p>This matter was reported to the police; however, the response has been protracted over several months, with a lack of communication and follow-up on their part. Despite our efforts to obtain updates, we have not received any correspondence for over two and a half months from the time of this writing. The incident remains classified as ‘open’ on the official police website. Due to this apparent inaction, WDH has been impeded in their ability to proceed with their responsibilities.</p>

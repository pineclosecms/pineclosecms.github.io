										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>On<strong> May 13th</strong>, <strong>2025</strong>, at approximately <strong>05:01,</strong>Â the resident of Flat Number 14 was observed violating his conditional order by pacing outside Flat 15â€™s door, a behavior noted to occur daily. During this time, a suspected drug transaction took place in plain view of the front door camera. An individual on a pushbike approached, exchanged money for a small packet containing a white substance with the resident, who then returned inside. Previous observations and reports indicate ongoing drug-related activity at Flat 14, including suspicious visitors, disturbances, and direct witnessing of similar transactions.<strong><br />

<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
WDH (now vico homes) | The Police | Logged on this CMS</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>On<strong> May 13th</strong>, <strong>2025</strong>, at approximately <strong>05:01, </strong>the resident of Flat Number 14 was observed exiting his flat, immediately walking and loitering in front of Flat Number 15.<br />
This is in violation of his conditional order yet is quickly becoming a more frequent daily occurrence.<br />
The resident was seen pacing for approximately three minutes outside Flat 15.<br />
During this time, a suspected drug transaction was captured on the front door camera.<br />
An individual wearing either a balaclava or a black cap and hoodie arrived on a pushbike.<br />
The resident of Flat 14 retrieved a small packet containing a white substance from his pocket and held it while the individual on the bicycle produced money.<br />
The two then exchanged items: the resident handed over the packet and accepted the cash before returning inside.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Context:<br />
</strong>* There have been ongoing concerns regarding suspected drug activity at Flat 14 for years now.<br />
* The resident has been overheard, through the bathroom ceiling, speaking on the phone about selling cocaine and storing proceeds in a digital account called &#8220;nest&#8221;.<br />
* Individuals with suspicious behavior have previously approached us, inquiring about the resident of number 14 and expressing a need to &#8220;get some stuff.&#8221;<br />
* There have been multiple incidents of disturbances, including a anorexic woman in distress shouting and banging at Flat 14â€™s door, reportedly due to an inability to purchase substances.<br />
* Both us and other neighbors have witnessed suspected drug transactions at Flat 14â€™s door on several occasions.</p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong><br />
The first three minutes of the residentâ€™s pacing have been condensed in the attached video for brevity.<br />
The footage then slows to normal speed to clearly show the arrival of the individual on the pushbike and the subsequent exchange.<br />
This incident is consistent with an ongoing pattern of suspected drug-related activity and repeated breaches of the residentâ€™s conditional order.<strong><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>On<strong> May 10th</strong>, <strong>2025</strong>, routine yet frequent foot traffic and activity were observed around Flat Number 14. Throughout the day, two individuals-a male in a grey hoodie with camouflage trousers and a shirtless male (later seen wearing a shirt)-were repeatedly seen approaching Flat 14â€™s door and lingering in the vicinity. Notably, both individuals frequently looked at Flat Number 15â€™s door, bins, and camera, often pausing to observe these areas as they moved about.<br />
While it is not standard practice for us to log daily foot traffic, this report serves as an example of the typical activity and comings and goings associated with Flat 14, where various individuals are regularly seen entering, exiting, and loitering near the premises.</p>

<strong>*</strong> At <strong>11:30</strong> A friend of the resident of flat Number 14 was seen walking slowly near the front area of the flat and looking at our door.<br />

<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>On <strong>May 9th</strong>,<strong> 2025</strong>, at approximately <strong>22:25</strong>, the resident of flat Number 14 was observed returning home accompanied by another individual.<br />
This individual appeared to be someone previously seen with the resident earlier that morning.<br />
We believe this person may be the same individual to whom the resident sold a bicycle a few months ago, who is known to work for the council, or possibly the person involved in a <a href="https://pineclose.uk/12may2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prior incident</a> where an associate of the resident attempted to open our door while the resident observed from a distance.<br />
Both individuals walked past our property, with the resident of Number 14 pointing/gesturing towards our bins and appearing to talk with the other person.<br />
After passing, the resident returned alone.<br />
At 22:26, he was seen walking slowly to the corner before returning towards his own door, repeatedly glancing at our door and bin area.<br />
This behavior is consistent with actions he exhibited prior to receiving a police caution.<br />
At 22:27, the other individual was observed walking past our door and leaving the premises. He was not seen again that evening.</p>
<p class="my-0">Earlier that day (approximately 11 hours earlier), a friend of the resident of Number 14 was observed slowly walking near the front area of the flat and examining our door. He approached Number 14â€™s door and was also captured on the side camera before departing, appearing to check his phone as he left.<br />
Although the side camera only recorded a few seconds, the footage has been included towards the end of the attached video for reference.</p>

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>of non-compliance with both law enforcement and housing authorities (WDH).<br />
<strong>Â </strong><strong>1.Â  11:48 AM</strong><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>Officers arrived at the location, as evidenced by photographic documentation.<br />
<strong>Â 2.Â  11:50 AM<br />
</strong>â€¨<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>At 11:50 AM (00:20 into the attached video), officers knocked loudly on the<br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>audible inside the property shortly before and after the knocking.<br />
<strong>Â 3.Â  Subsequent Attempts</strong><br />
â—¦Â Â Â Â At 11:50 AM (00:42 in video), officers knocked again, followed by additional<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>knocks at 11:51 AM (01:10 and 01:44 in video).<br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>with an officer for around 40 seconds before closing the door at 11:53 AM.<br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>walking around the area, looking up at the windows in an attempt to locate<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>the resident but were unsuccessful.<br />
<strong>Â 5.Â  Further Attempts to Make Contact</strong><br />
â—¦Â Â Â Â Officers knocked again at 11:58 AM (05:47 in video) and continued to be<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>ignored, with only an aggressive dog barking from within.<br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>(06:48 in video). A loud bang was heard from above during this time,<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>indicating the resident&#8217;s presence.<br />
â—¦Â Â Â Â Despite further attempts at knocking shortly thereafter<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>(12:00 PM, 07:02 in video), the officers were still ignored.<br />
<strong>Â 6.Â  Revisiting Neighbor for Discussion</strong><br />
â—¦Â Â Â Â At 12:02 PM (08:22 in video), officers returned to our door to discuss the<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>situation regarding number 14. During this time, they knocked again on<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>number 14 at 12:03 PM (08:46 in video) but received no response.<br />
â—¦Â Â Â Â Officers returned to speak with Lucy again at 12:03 PM (09:16 in video), where<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>they explained that due to the residentâ€™s continued non-compliance and their<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>inability to confirm his presence, they could not enter the property.<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>They advised that we should call 101 when we are certain of his presence and<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>warn them about the aggressive dog that had previously attempted to<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>snatch an officer&#8217;s baton at the letterbox.<br />

<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>at 12:06 PM (11:01 in video).<br />

<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>On <strong>September 28, 2024</strong>, at approximately <strong>11:05 AM</strong>, officers arrived at Pine Close in an attempt to conduct a Vulnerability Assessment (VA) for the resident of flat no#14. This was not their first attempt, as the resident has a history of ignoring both the police and WDH.<br />
The officers departed at precisely <strong>11:09 AM</strong>. Less than one minute later, the resident was observed exiting his flat with his dog.<br />
Upon noticing a police vehicle driving down a street out of camera view, he was seen hastily returning to his flat, pulling the dog along.<br />
At <strong>3:49 PM</strong>, nearly five hours after the initial attempt, the police returned to make another effort to communicate with the resident of flat no#14.<br />
This time, they waited longer than before and the officers became aware that the resident was present and deliberately ignoring them, as he was spotted in the window and overheard shouting at his dog for barking.<br />
At <strong>3:52 PM</strong>, after being ignored once again, the police left the premises.<br />
Subsequently, the resident remained inside the apartment for approximately six hours, during which time intermittent stomping, banging, and shouting were heard.<br />
from <strong>9:30 PM</strong>, the resident of flat no#14 was observed walking around outside our flat on multiple occasions over several hours.<br />
At <strong>10:32 PM</strong>, he can be seen looking through our window while passing our flat.<br />
Following this, he returned to his apartment briefly, where stomping noises were heard for a couple of minutes. He then came back outside and continued to walk around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:</strong><br />
On the 25th of September, 2023, I was subjected to an unprovoked assault while smoking outside my residence. At that time, we had not anticipated the need for surveillance equipment due to our amicable relations with the surrounding residents and the absence of any prior hostilities. Regrettably, the only available footage captures the aftermath of the incident, including the assailant’s aggressive attempts to gain entry into our residence prior to the arrival of law enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>Assault Summery:<br />
</strong>The presumed catalyst for the assailant’s behavior may be attributed to substance depletion, likely cocaine, which possibly exacerbated his already erratic conduct. This incident followed our formal complaint regarding excessive noise emanating from his residence—a matter we had previously addressed through civil discourse to no avail, as corroborated by WDH and the environmental health agency’s unsuccessful attempts at communication.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for assault:</strong><br />
We think he had run out of cocaine, and was acting childish because we had recently reported him for making too much noise (which we attempted to speak with him about like polite adults, as have WDH and the environmental health agency to no avail because he simply ignores everyone.)</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
The altercation was promptly reported to both WDH and the police. The responding officers apprehended the assailant; however, he was released subsequent to providing a counterstatement alleging self-defense. Upon his return, he inflicted damage to the exterior wall of our residence. The incident was recorded by WDH, but the response from the assigned representative, Richard, was unsatisfactory, as he displayed a lack of interest in resolving our concerns and failed to include us in the out-of-hours service list at the time it was needed. This oversight resulted in missed opportunities for intervention. Since then, the assailant has engaged in deliberate noise disturbances at irregular intervals, complicating the process for WDH representatives to witness the infractions.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>The incident necessitated immediate medical attention for Michael at the Accident and Emergency department due to significant facial swelling and an ocular injury, which impaired his vision for an extended period exceeding two months. The assault resulted in a diagnosed concussion, facial contusions, and an eye trauma. The repercussions extended beyond physical injuries, inducing considerable psychological distress and apprehension. The fear instigated by the event led to a marked reduction in our willingness to leave the residence, a cessation of previous habits such as smoking outside, and a reluctance to venture out after dark. The presence of the assailant in the vicinity continues to be a source of anxiety, with concerns over potential recurrence of such violence. For enhanced security, we have altered our sleeping arrangements, opting to stay in the living room, which is strategically located closer to the entrance. Concerns also persist regarding the integrity of the property’s entrance, following the assailant’s repeated attempts to compromise it. Despite attempts to address the situation through written communication, there has been a lack of response and no discernible resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />
The assault has had lasting effects, with persistent discomfort in my eye, which remains sensitive to touch. The assailant explicitly threatened our lives, and the physical aggression was directed solely at me, with the potential for further harm had we not retreated indoors. Medical professionals at the Accident and Emergency department confirmed the severity of the concussion. There were false allegations made to the police by the assailant, claiming I was the instigator. Following his release, he engaged in further destructive behavior, damaging the wall adjacent to our residence, which is believed to be part of multiple attempts to gain unauthorized entry.</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>while I was smoking outside my residence and concurrently relocating refuse that had been improperly deposited at our doorstep, I was approached in an aggressive manner by the occupant of 14 Pine Close. This individual vociferously questioned my actions with profanity and proceeded to physically assault me without provocation. In self-defense, I attempted to disengage by obstructing his vision, pulling his jacket over his face, but he escalated the altercation by forcibly throwing me to the ground, inserting his finger into my ocular cavity, and continuing to strike me. This assault induced a sensation of unconsciousness, and had it not been for the intervention of my partner, who requires my care due to her disabilities, I believe the assailant could have caused permanent blindness or further harm.</p>
<p>We managed to retreat to the safety of our residence and promptly alerted the authorities. Meanwhile, the assailant continued his violent behavior, causing damage to the property’s entrance, necessitating repairs by WDH. Upon the arrival of law enforcement, the assailant was detained, and I was sent to the Accident and Emergency department for medical evaluation. Despite the severity of my injuries, which included facial swelling, impaired vision, and necessitated the consumption of analgesics for an extended period, the assailant was only subjected to a brief incarceration. Furthermore, upon his release, he immediately resumed his destructive actions by damaging the wall adjacent to our doorway, which again required repair services provided by WDH.</p>

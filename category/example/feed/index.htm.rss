										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>On<strong> May 10th</strong>, <strong>2025</strong>, routine yet frequent foot traffic and activity were observed around Flat Number 14. Throughout the day, two individuals-a male in a grey hoodie with camouflage trousers and a shirtless male (later seen wearing a shirt)-were repeatedly seen approaching Flat 14â€™s door and lingering in the vicinity. Notably, both individuals frequently looked at Flat Number 15â€™s door, bins, and camera, often pausing to observe these areas as they moved about.<br />
While it is not standard practice for us to log daily foot traffic, this report serves as an example of the typical activity and comings and goings associated with Flat 14, where various individuals are regularly seen entering, exiting, and loitering near the premises.</p>

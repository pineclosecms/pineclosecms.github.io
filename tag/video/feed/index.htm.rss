<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>made another attempt to apprehend the resident of 14 Pine Close.<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>This action followed numerous unsuccessful requests for the individual to<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>attend a voluntary appearance (VA). The resident has a documented history<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>of non-compliance with both law enforcement and housing authorities (WDH).<br />
<strong> </strong><strong>1.  11:48 AM</strong><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>Officers arrived at the location, as evidenced by photographic documentation.<br />
<strong> 2.  11:50 AM<br />
</strong> <span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>At 11:50 AM (00:20 into the attached video), officers knocked loudly on the<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>door of 14 Pine Close. The resident ignored this attempt, despite being<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>audible inside the property shortly before and after the knocking.<br />
<strong> 3.  Subsequent Attempts</strong><br />
◦    At 11:50 AM (00:42 in video), officers knocked again, followed by additional<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>knocks at 11:51 AM (01:10 and 01:44 in video).<br />
◦    Shortly after, Lucy answered the door at 11:52 AM (02:55 in video) and spoke<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>with an officer for around 40 seconds before closing the door at 11:53 AM.<br />
<strong> 4.  Continued Ignoring</strong><br />
◦    At 11:54 AM (04:08 in video), officers knocked on number 14 once more<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>but received no response.<br />
◦    Between 11:55 AM and 11:56 AM (04:55 in video), officers were observed<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>walking around the area, looking up at the windows in an attempt to locate<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>the resident but were unsuccessful.<br />
<strong> 5.  Further Attempts to Make Contact</strong><br />
◦    Officers knocked again at 11:58 AM (05:47 in video) and continued to be<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>ignored, with only an aggressive dog barking from within.<br />
◦    Additional knocks occurred at 11:59 AM (06:10 in video) and again at 12:00 PM<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>(06:48 in video). A loud bang was heard from above during this time,<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>indicating the resident&#8217;s presence.<br />
◦    Despite further attempts at knocking shortly thereafter<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>(12:00 PM, 07:02 in video), the officers were still ignored.<br />
<strong> 6.  Revisiting Neighbor for Discussion</strong><br />
◦    At 12:02 PM (08:22 in video), officers returned to our door to discuss the<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>situation regarding number 14. During this time, they knocked again on<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>number 14 at 12:03 PM (08:46 in video) but received no response.<br />
◦    Officers returned to speak with Lucy again at 12:03 PM (09:16 in video), where<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>they explained that due to the resident’s continued non-compliance and their<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>inability to confirm his presence, they could not enter the property.<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>They advised that we should call 101 when we are certain of his presence and<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>warn them about the aggressive dog that had previously attempted to<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>snatch an officer&#8217;s baton at the letterbox.<br />
<strong> 7.  Conclusion of Visit</strong><br />
◦    The officers left at 12:05 PM (10:48 in video) and were seen driving away<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>at 12:06 PM (11:01 in video).<br />
◦    Additional evidence includes a photo of their arrival at 11:48 AM<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>(11:22 in video) and a video from a living room window showing one officer<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>looking up at the flat windows of number 14 at 11:52 AM (11:33 in video),<br />
<span style="color: #333333;">&#8212;-</span>which also displayed egg residue from prior incidents.</p>

<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>On <strong>September 28, 2024</strong>, at approximately <strong>11:05 AM</strong>, officers arrived at Pine Close in an attempt to conduct a Vulnerability Assessment (VA) for the resident of flat no#14. This was not their first attempt, as the resident has a history of ignoring both the police and WDH.<br />
The officers departed at precisely <strong>11:09 AM</strong>. Less than one minute later, the resident was observed exiting his flat with his dog.<br />
Upon noticing a police vehicle driving down a street out of camera view, he was seen hastily returning to his flat, pulling the dog along.<br />
At <strong>3:49 PM</strong>, nearly five hours after the initial attempt, the police returned to make another effort to communicate with the resident of flat no#14.<br />
This time, they waited longer than before and the officers became aware that the resident was present and deliberately ignoring them, as he was spotted in the window and overheard shouting at his dog for barking.<br />
At <strong>3:52 PM</strong>, after being ignored once again, the police left the premises.<br />
Subsequently, the resident remained inside the apartment for approximately six hours, during which time intermittent stomping, banging, and shouting were heard.<br />
from <strong>9:30 PM</strong>, the resident of flat no#14 was observed walking around outside our flat on multiple occasions over several hours.<br />
At <strong>10:32 PM</strong>, he can be seen looking through our window while passing our flat.<br />
Following this, he returned to his apartment briefly, where stomping noises were heard for a couple of minutes. He then came back outside and continued to walk around.</p>

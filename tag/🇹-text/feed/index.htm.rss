										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>on the 14th August 2023, we were tidying up in the Living Room and out of nowhere, for no reason at all, the neighbour from upstairs came stomping down and threw an entire box of eggs all over our living room windows and ran off up the street.</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
WDH</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>We became very stressed, rang Richard from WDH anti-social department who came to look at what had been done. Lucy was too stressed &amp; worried and had to go over to her mum&#8217;s to calm down from the stress as it was causing bad chest pains, feeling dizzy and berating funny, yet another example of an instance he could have killed her with his childish behavior, and this is one of the lesser things he&#8217;s done.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Very Stressed, windows all egged <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>(happened again and again after cleaning)</em></span>, Lucy almost passed out from stress and had to leave <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(could have been worse.)</span></p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>Upstairs had already been stomping about shouting all day and we couldn&#8217;t concentrate on anything much.<br />
We were both in the living room tidying up and suddenly for no reason at all, the tenant of number 14 came stomping down stairs with a full box of eggs and threw them all at our room window, then ran off down the street laughing like a child.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>on the 29th June 2023, we were woken by constant banging, stomping and shouting for hours on end, we couldn&#8217;t concentrate on anything or get any sleep at all,</p>
<p><strong>Reported To:</strong><br />
WDH</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Extreme stress caused, both in tears and not knowing what to do. We contacted one call who reported it again as a noise complaint. We had been woken up again and then due to the noise couldn’t get back to sleep or get any sleep during the day due to it.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:<br />
</strong>Very Stressed, Lucy has stress chest pain, can&#8217;t sleep, can&#8217;t concentrate</p>
<p><strong>Details:<br />
</strong>We were woken up around 3AM to extremely loud banging and shouting, every time we tried to get back to sleep we were woken back up by it, so we got up and sat in the room for some time where we were unable to concentrate on anything, we ended up so stressed we were both in tears and Lucy&#8217;s chest became painful. As we&#8217;ve mentioned before it&#8217;s not good for her heart conditions and at this rate will eventually kill her, we&#8217;ve even posted letters to them in the past telling them that she has heart conditions and got completely ignored, told WDH multiple times to no avail.<br />
The noise continued until 7AM, by that point we were too stressed to get to sleep for hours anyway.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">in the above-named person making a statement in relation to multiple reports I made to the police regarding my neighbour harassing me and my partner.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The harassment has also involved an assault, criminal damage and theft.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The neighbour in question is a male, I believe to be Nathaniel Beech who lives in the flat above me.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Me and my partner moved into our bottom floor flat in November 2022 in which everything was fine for a couple of months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In <strong>January 2023</strong> Nathaniel who lives above us started playing music really loud on the night time, this was in the early hours of the morning, mainly on weekends.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In <strong>April 2023</strong> we decided to address the problem as it was not stopping, in which we wrote a letter politely after we could stop playing music loud after midnight.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We tried knocking to hand this to him in person, but him and his friends stood at the window laughing at us therefore, I just posted this through this letter box.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have a copy of this letter I posted in which I will exhibit it as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 1</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nothing changed after his letters were posted, If anything, things got worse.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Due to this I made a complaint to the council in May 2023 in which they said they would send a noise warning letter to him.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The council has even been out to speak to him, in which he has avoided them and run away.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nathaniel still insisted on playing loud music on a weekend</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="5th February 2023" rel="noopener" href="/5feb2023/"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 1</span></a></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the <strong>23rd </strong>of<strong> June 2023</strong> we were woken up by Nathaniel, playing extremely loud music in the early hours of the morning.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">My partner banged on the ceiling to get his attention to turn the music down in which Nathaniel just banged back so we did this again.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nathaniel has then run downstairs and started punching at our front door and threatening us as well, telling us to come outside as he was going to bray us.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He was very aggressive and angry.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He then grabbed one of our outdoor furniture chairs and tried to use this to push our front door, in which he broke our chair.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He then grabbed our second chair and threw that at our door causing this chair to also break these chairs both belong to me, I bought them and I&#8217;m the owner of them.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He had no right or authority to break these chairs.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I took pictures of the damage he has caused and I will exhibit these as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 2</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We stayed inside during this incident in which, after around 10 to 15 minutes, Nathaniel returned upstairs.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="23rd June 2023" rel="noopener" href="/23jun2023/"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 2</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the <strong>14th </strong>of<strong> August 2023</strong> Nathaniel had thrown eggs at our front window, me and my partner was inside our property.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We heard Nathaniel running downstairs.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He then threw a pack of a dozen eggs at our front window.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We were sitting in our front room to witness him do this and then run off down the street.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We then contacted one from the antisocial department room Wakefield Council, in which they came out and said that they were going to write to Nathaniel about this.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was disappointed in this response, as I was told not to talk to the police for which, looking back at wish I did, I have had to spend my time cleaning our window to get all of the eggs off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the <strong>25th </strong>of<strong> September 2023</strong> Nathaniel assaulted my partner and tried to break into our flat, at around 8 pm. My partner and I were inside our flat and I heard a big bang.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">My partner said if he needed a cigarette and he would go and have a look to see what the noise was.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We then found a pot that we had put outside to feed the animals had been thrown.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">This was not damaged, but all the animal food had come out of it, showing that it had been thrown, there was also a lot of quick grass that had been thrown at our door, causing a mess to be outside of our front door.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We then brushed it away, in which we saw Nathaniel stood at his window watching us.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He then came running down and outside.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He was being aggressive shouting “what the fuck are you doing”.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I told him I was going to ring the police to which he responded with “I do not care”</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nathaniel then punched my partner on the side of the face in which he was concussed and had a significant burse to the side.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nathaniel dragged my partner to the grass pavement and got him to the floor, he was using his hands and tried to stick his fingers into his eyes.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I called the police and attempted to get Nathaniel off my partner by pulling his boxer pants.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">My partner managed to get free, in which we both ran into our flat, Nathaniel followed us and attempted to force his way into our flat.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He was pushing the door open, even when we walked away from the door, he attempts to enter.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He managed to open our door slightly, but police arrived and arrested him for assaulting my partner, in which my partner provided a statement for this.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have CCTV of Nathaniel trying to gain access to our flat which<br />
I will exhibit as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 3</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I also have photos of my partner&#8217;s injuries, which I will exhibit as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 4</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I believe there was no further action from this incident</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="25th September 2023" rel="noopener" href="/25sep2023/"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 3</span></a>   <a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="25th September 2023" rel="noopener" href="/25sep2023#photos"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 4</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">on the <strong>18th </strong>of<strong> December 2023</strong> around half two in the morning, Nathaniel came running downstairs banging on our front door, shouting Shut the fuck up, in which we were both asleep until this awoke me.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He then egged the front door, front window, bathroom window and kitchen window, we were unsure why he did this as we made no noise at all, our CCTV footage of this from within our flat in which he can be heard,<br />
I will exhibit this as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 5</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I got back in touch with the council which they informed me that our case was closed as they could not get in touch with him.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">From this third report, our case got reopened.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="18th December 2023" rel="noopener" href="/18dec2023/"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 5</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the <strong>10th </strong>of<strong> January 2024</strong>, my partner and I went out for my birthday.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We saw Nathaniel at his window as we left in a taxi.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We returned home at around 10 p.m. in which we saw lots of smashed glass on the floor and noticed the glass panel in our front door had been smashed.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I called my mum for advice on how to report this and how to get my door fixed.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We had a letterbox camera which has audio and voices can be heard in this before a smash is heard.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I will exhibit this audio footage, as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 6</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have also taken photos of the damage caused which I will exhibit as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 7</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The police did not have enough evidence to arrest him, in which there was no further action on this case.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="10th January 2024" rel="noopener" href="/10jan2024/"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 6</span></a>  <a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="10th January 2024" rel="noopener" href="/10jan2024#photos"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 7</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">on the <strong>9th </strong>of<strong> March 2024</strong> at 4:14AM, Nathaniel was videoing through our letterbox.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We had our letterbox moving, which I checked our camera which is when I’ve seen Nathaniel.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">when looking he has had his phone in front of him looking at our door.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">By the time I checked the cameras, he was gone.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nathaniel returned at 6:10AM, in which he did the same thing.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">This time he had his flashlight on his phone showing he was filming.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I had this on CCTV, which I will exhibit as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 8</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I rang the council about this straight away after the incident in which they told me I had to ring the police, and when I called the police, they set me up an appointment in which an officer was sent the following day to establish whether or not this could be a Burglary or not.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">An officer attended, which is when the harassment was logged.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="9th March 2024" rel="noopener" href="/09mar2024"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 8</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the <strong>1st </strong>of<strong> April 2024</strong> our drain pipe was pulled out.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our drainpipe was located at the side of our property so our CCTV does not cover the damage taken place. However, it can be seen going past our front door towards the side of our flat, a large bang is heard and then he returned, and you can hear him go back upstairs.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I will exhibit the CCTV footage as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 9</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I also took photos of the damage which I will exhibit as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 10</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We noticed a damage the following day, in which this is when we reported it to the Council and police, in which this added to our ongoing harassment case.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="1st April 2024" rel="noopener" href="/01apr2024"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 9</span></a>  <a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="1st April 2024" rel="noopener" href="/01apr2024#photos"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 10</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the <strong>26th </strong>of<strong> April 2024</strong> we had a big bang at half five In the morning.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We looked on our camera and we could see Nathaniel outside our front door.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He was moving our outside chair around,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">spitting at our door and sticking his finger up at our camera in our window.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He also broke our bird feeder before walking off of this.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We later found this in our brown bin, it was trashed and not reusable.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have CCTV footage of this which I will exhibit as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 11</strong></em></span><strong><br />
<a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="26th April 2024" rel="noopener" href="/26apr2024"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 11</span></a><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the <strong>12th </strong>of<strong> May 2024</strong> Nathaniel was with a friend at approximately 9:50pm.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The friend he was with tried out our door handle.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">My partner shouted, asking what he was doing in which he could then be seen leaving and heard going upstairs in the final shot.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I&#8217;m unsure of the details for his friend and because of this, I did not report this to the police.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I will exhibit the CCTV as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 12</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="12th May 2024" rel="noopener" href="/12may2024"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 12</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the <strong>8th </strong>of<strong> June 2024</strong> Nathaniel punched the outside light, no damage was caused. At around 1:30AM I was watching through our camera and I could see Nathaniel walking past our door various times recording on his phone.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nathaniel then punched our outdoor light before turning back to his flat</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I Have CCTV of this incident which I will exhibit it as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 13</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I called the police in which they sent someone out to have a look,<br />
but nothing else came of this.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="8th June 2024" rel="noopener" href="/8june2024"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 13</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the <strong>15th </strong>of <strong>June 2024</strong> Nathaniel can be seen making an aggressive hand at our camera we have sat up at the window.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">This was ‘sticking one up’ at it, I will exabit this footage as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 14</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="15th June 2024" rel="noopener" href="/15jun2024"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 14</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the <strong>16th </strong>of<strong> August 2024</strong> Nathaniel smashed our animal water tub.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He could be seen walking his dog outside our house and he then throws an object at our front door before coming close to our door.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He then kicked our water tub that we had outside for the animals, causing it to brake.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have CCTV footage of this which I exhibit as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 15</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I also took pictures of the damage that I will exhibit as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 16</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I replaced this dish later on in the day in which Nathaniel returns<br />
to also break this one.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have this on CCTV also and will exhibit it as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 17</strong></em></span> and a photo of this further damage as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 18</strong></em></span>.</span><br />

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the <strong>14th </strong>of<strong> September 2024</strong> he took our outside chairs away from our property,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">spat on our door and used our animal water bowl to dispose of his cigarette.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">On this day he kept going in and out of his flat in which each time he&#8217;s done something different to us.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He kept looking around prior to doing something to<br />
ensure no one else was around.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We later found out chairs at the bottom of the road.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have CCTV covering these incidents, which are an exhibit at <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 19</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="14th September 2024" rel="noopener" href="/14sep2024"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 19</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the <strong>21st </strong>of<strong> September 2024</strong>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He was outside our flat, taking pictures, spitting on our doors and chais, and was locking at our front door near enough all day.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">It was around 11:18AM which I could see him on our cameras holding his phone up to our house, he can even be seen doing this through our bedroom window.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Later on in the day he was stood at our front door just staring at it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have all these instances CCTV which I will exhibit as <span style="font-family: 'arial black', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>LCT 20</strong></em></span>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a class="maxbutton-1 maxbutton maxbutton-lct" target="_blank" title="21th September 2024" rel="noopener" href="/21sep2024"><span class='mb-text'>LCT 20</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I do not give Nathaniel Beech the right or authority to constantly harass me and my partner, we try not to interact with him so I am not sure why he keeps persistently targeting us.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">We even avoid going outside after 2PM unless we really have to as we do not want any trouble.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">he has damaged property belonging to us.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He has taken our property away from us and assaulted my partner in the past which was unprovoked.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He is the only person we&#8217;ve ever had a negative interaction with.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">He was fine with us the first month we moved in, but then for no reason at all, he developed a hatred towards us.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">This incident is making me feel awful.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I feel like I do not have a life.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">It is affecting me mentally and causing me stress which led to me being ill.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I do not understand why he would spend his time doing this to impact our lives.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">All I want is for him to leave us alone.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am willing to attend court and support prosecution in relation to this matter.</span></p>

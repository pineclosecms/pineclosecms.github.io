										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>Between the 18th June 2023 and the 24th July 2023 we produced a set of log&#8217;s detailing everything we could hear in detail for Richard of WDH.</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong><br />
For just short of a month we created details logs of everything we heard in that time, the information logged is arranged in an easy to understand way and scored between 1 and 10 on how bad the noise was, and what times.<br />
We originally created these for Richard at WDH as he said written logs could help however he didn&#8217;t seem to be interested in them nor did he bring anything up regarding them.</p>
<p><strong>Document :</strong> (Detailed logs given to Richard at WDH for the 28th June 2023 &#8211; 24th July 2023)<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summery:<br />
</strong>on the 23rd June 2023,we gave a letter directly to Richard from WDH <em>alongside our some log sheets he had recommended we temporary do</em>.<br />
The letter details the concerns we had at the time and explained things upto that point, however nothing ever came of it.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br />
</strong>Letter was probably never even read.</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong><br />
We prepared a letter for Richard from WDH who we were working with at the time regarding our issue with number 14, we felt it easier to prepare it all in the letter than remembering everything on the spot whilst he was here, issues it&#8217;s caused us, tenant of number 14 threatening us at the door, potential risk of death from Lucy&#8217;s heart conditions, property we&#8217;ve had destroyed and several other things, however we never heard nothing back from it and just kept being asked the same generic questions over and over until our issue was closed without being resolved at all.<br />
It detailed the noise we hear</p>
